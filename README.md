# CFOP Research

The report will appear [HERE](https://akiradeveloper.github.io/cfop-research/).

The aim of this project is to find PLLs that can be a form of
(OLL1)(OLL2) like T perm or Y perm.

The idea is firstly enumerate all OLL candidates and find the pairs that
effects the same as some PLL.

Current Status: 18/21 PLLs can be of the form.

This project uses [rubikmaster](https://github.com/akiradeveloper/rubikmaster) library
and Rayon for data parallelism.
